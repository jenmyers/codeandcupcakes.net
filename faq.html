        <p class="faq-question">I donâ€™t know anything about coding is that ok?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">Yes! The workshop is designed so that mothers and daughters with little to no experience can be introduced to the world of coding.</p>

        <p class="faq-question">Do I need a laptop?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">We provide laptops for each mother/daughter pair. If you would like to bring your own laptop please feel free to do so - but you do not need to bring your own laptop.</p>

        <p class="faq-question">The workshops are not in my neighborhood - any plans on workshops anywhere else?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">We are always looking for new locations to host our workshops - if you have an idea for a location please let us know by sending us an <a href="mailto:hello@codeandcupcakes.net">email</a>.</p>

        <p class="faq-question">What kind of cupcakes are there?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">Currently we offer regular cupcakes, as well as vegan, gluten free and peanut/tree-nut free options. Cupcakes come from <a href="http://www.swirlzcupcakes.com/">Swirlz Cupcakes</a> and <a href="http://nutphrees.com/">Nutphree's Bakery</a>. We try to accommodate diet restrictions as much as we can but can not guarantee we can get to all of them. If you are attending a workshop please let us know if you have special dietary restrictions.</p>

        <p class="faq-question">Are the workshops only for mothers and daughters?<p class="faq-answer">Right now our workshops are centered around mother/daughter pairs and attendee feedback has been that they appreciate a space designed especially for them. As we grow, we are considering offering workshop oriented towards bigger families and different combinations of family members. In the meantime, you can talk to an organization like <a href="http://coderdojochi.org/">Coderdojo Chicago</a> to find out if they have upcoming classes for you to attend.</p>

        <p class="faq-question">Can I bring two girls?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">Yes we can accommodate mothers with multiple daughters. You can contact us for special links to register.</p>

        <p class="faq-question">What ages do the girls have to be to attend?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">We can accommodate girls of all ages but we feel that due to the material a girl that is at least seven years old would benefit most from the workshops.</p>

        <p class="faq-question">I want to participate, but are is there a free scholarship I can use to attend?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">We want everyone to be able to participate in our workshops, so we offer a number of free scholarships that include a mother/daughter pair ticket plus two single-day city transit passes. If you would like to apply for a scholarship, please fill out our <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Sg9u177L4NO0wlwtGS0UhHcz-Subnfzq8I5PSXA9tI4/viewform">scholarship application</a>.</p>

        <p class="faq-question">I am having trouble finding transportation to the workshops?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">We can't offer direct transportation to the workshop, but we do offer two single-day city transit passes for those in need. Please <a href="mailto:hello@codeandcupcakes.net">contact us</a> for arrangements.</p>
