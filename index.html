      <p>In our workshops, we learn the basics of web development with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. And cupcakes. If you would like to host your own workshop, you can use all of our prepared workshop materials, including a slidedeck, lessons and event guide.</p>

      <p>All Code and Cupcakes workshop materials are available at GitHub.</p>

      <a href="https://github.com/codeandcupcakes" class="button-solid-host">Workshop Materials on GitHub</a>

      <p>You can fork the repository or download individual files directly. <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/learning-about-github">GitHub has some documentation on getting started with their platform</a> if you find that useful. You can also submit pull requests if you find any issues or would like to share an improvement that can be incorporated into the primary material repository.</p>

      <p>Workshop materials are licensed by a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike</a> license, which means anyone can use, adapt and share the materials as long as they don't charge money for them or place additional restrictions on them. The idea is to make these workshops accessible to everyone. ðŸ™‚</p>
