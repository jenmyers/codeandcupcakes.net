      <p>In our workshops, we start learning the basics of web development with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We provide laptops for each mother/daughter pair to work with, wireless internet connection, guided instruction, a team of teaching assistants and, of course, cupcakes (including vegan, gluten-free and peanut/tree-nut-free, plus beverages). There is no set age range, but you and your daughter will probably get the most out of the workshop if she is old enough to fully participate (7+). We use an online text editor that allows you to save your work to your own free account, so you can keep it and build on it. We'll also send you off with a list of resources to keep learning.</p>
